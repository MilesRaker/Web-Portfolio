# Project Name
This project is called "Web Portfolio".
## Description
This Web Portfolio is an independent project I developed during my time at Codeup, a web design bootcamp that focuses on the Spring framework. In an effort to expand my skillset, I chose to build this project using React, which is my first experience working with the technology. The project serves two main purposes: 1) to showcase my knowledge of React to potential employers, and 2) to serve as a digital resume. Developing this project was a valuable learning experience, and I am proud of the work I have accomplished.## Features
